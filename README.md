# user_oidc

OpenID Connect user backend for Nextcloud

## General usage
See [Nextcloud and OpenID-Connect](https://www.schiessle.org/articles/2020/07/26/nextcloud-and-openid-connect/)
for a proper jumpstart.

### User IDs

The OpenID Connect backend will ensure that user ids are unique even when multiple providers would report the same user
id to ensure that a user cannot identify for the same Nextcloud account through different providers.
Therefore, a hash of the provider id and the user id is used. This behaviour can be turned off in the provider options.

## Commandline settings
The app could also be configured by commandline.

### Provider entries
Providers are located by provider identifier.

To list all configured providers, use:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ user_oidc:provider
```

To show detailed provider configuration, use:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ user_oidc:provider demoprovider
```

A provider is created if none with the given identifier exists and all parameters are given:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ user_oidc:provider demoprovider --clientid="WBXCa003871" \
    --clientsecret="lbXy***********" --discoveryuri="https://accounts.example.com/openid-configuration"
```

Attribute mappings can be optionally specified. For more details refer to `occ user_oidc:provider --help`.

To delete a provider, use:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ user_oidc:provider:remove demoprovider
  Are you sure you want to delete OpenID Provider demoprovider
  and may invalidate all assiciated user accounts.
```
To skip the confirmation, use `--force`.

***Warning***: be careful with the deletion of a provider because in some setup, this invalidates access to all
NextCloud accounts associated with this provider.


### ID4me option
ID4me is an application setting switch which is configurable as normal Nextcloud app setting:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:app:set --value=1 user_oidc id4me_enabled
```

### Disable other login methods
If there is only one OpenID Connect provider configured, it can be made the default login
method and the user would get redirected to the provider immediately for the
login. Admins can still use the regular login through adding the `?direct=1`
parameter to the login URL.

```bash
sudo -u www-data php var/www/nextcloud/occ config:app:set --value=0 user_oidc allow_multiple_user_backends
```

### Single logout

Single logout is enabled by default. When logging out of Nextcloud,
the end_session_endpoint of the OpenID Connect provider is requested to end the session on this side.

It can be disabled in `config.php`:
``` php
'user_oidc' => [
    'single_logout' => false,
],
```

### Backchannel logout

[OpenId backchannel logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html) is supported by this app.
You just have to configure 2 settings for the OpenId client (on the provider side, Keycloak for example):
1. Backchannel Logout URL: If your Nextcloud base URL is https://my.nextcloud.org
and your OpenId provider identifier (on the Nextcloud side) is "myOidcProvider"
set the backchannel Logout URL to
https://my.nextcloud.org/index.php/apps/user_oidc/backchannel-logout/myOidcProvider .
This URL is provided for each provider in the OpenID Connect admin settings.
2. Enable the "Backchannel Logout Session Required" setting.

### Auto provisioning

By default, this app provisions the users with the information contained in the OIDC token
which means it gets the user information (such as the display name or the email) from the ID provider.
This also means that user_oidc takes care of creating the users when they first log in.

It is possible to disable auto provisioning to let other user backends (like LDAP)
take care of user creation and attribute mapping.
This leaves user_oidc to only take care of authentication.

Auto provisioning can be disabled in `config.php`:
``` php
'user_oidc' => [
    'auto_provision' => false,
],
```

:warning: When relying on the LDAP user backend for user provisioning, you need to adjust the
"Login Attributes" section and the Expert tab's "Internal Username" value of your LDAP settings.
Even if LDAP does not handle the login process,
the user_oidc app will trigger an LDAP search when logging in to make sure the user is created if it was
not synced already.
So it is essential that:
* the OpenID Connect "User ID mapping" attribute matches the LDAP Expert tab's "Internal Username".
The attribute names can be different but their values should match. Do not change the LDAP configuration,
simply adapt the OpenID Connect provider configuration.
* the OpenID Connect "User ID mapping" attribute can be used in the LDAP login query
defined in the "Login Attributes" tab.

In other words, make sure that your OpenID Connect provider's "User ID mapping" setting is set to an attribute
which provides the same values as the LDAP attribute set in "Internal Username" in your LDAP settings.

### UserInfo request for Bearer token validation

The OIDC tokens used to make API call to Nextcloud might have been generated by an external entity.
It is possible that they don't contain the user ID attribute. In this case, this attribute
can be requested to the provider's `userinfo` endpoint.

Add this to `config.php` to enable such extra validation step:
``` php
'user_oidc' => [
    'userinfo_bearer_validation' => true,
],
```

If you only want the token to be validated against the `userinfo` endpoint,
it is possible to disable the classic "self-encoded" validation:
``` php
'user_oidc' => [
    'userinfo_bearer_validation' => true,
    'selfencoded_bearer_validation' => false,
],
```

## Building the app

Requirements for building:
- Node.js 14
- NPM 7
- PHP
- composer

The app uses [krankerl](https://github.com/ChristophWurst/krankerl) to build the release archive from the git repository.
The release will be put into `build/artifacts/` when running the `krankerl package`.

The app can also be built without krankerl by manually running:
```
composer install --no-dev -o
npm ci
npm run build
```

On Ubuntu 20.04, a possible way to get build working is with matching npm and node versions is:
```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo npm install -g npm@7
```
